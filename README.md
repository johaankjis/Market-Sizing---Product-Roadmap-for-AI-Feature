## 🎨 Customization

### Updating Market Data
Edit the initial state in `components/market-sizing-card.tsx`:
```typescript
const [tam, setTam] = useState(2400)  // Total Addressable Market
const [samPercentage, setSamPercentage] = useState(50)  // SAM as % of TAM
const [somPercentage, setSomPercentage] = useState(30)  // SOM as % of SAM
```

### Adding Features
Features can be added dynamically through the UI or by modifying the initial data in `components/feature-prioritization.tsx`.
